## Recent Projects

### [Autonomous Self-Improving Software Teams](https://github.com/hungson175/AI-teams-controller-public)
Multi-agent teams based on Claude Code + tmux where AI agents collaborate autonomously on sprints. Features include:
- Team-based sprint workflow (PO, Scrum Master, Tech Lead, Frontend, Backend, QA)
- Memory system enabling teams to self-improve and get better over time
- Progressive implementation pattern
- Git-driven progress tracking

### [Coder-Mem](https://github.com/hungson175/coder-mem)
Reverse-engineered Claude Code to give it **memory capabilities** so coding agents can learn and improve themselves over time.

### [Deep-Research](https://github.com/hungson175/deep-research-langchain)
Rewrote GPT-Researcher architecture from LangGraph to LangChain - autonomous research system for comprehensive multi-source analysis.

### [AI Coding Agent Memory Guide](https://github.com/hungson175/AI-teams-controller-public/blob/master/memory-system/docs/tech/memory_guide_draft_v7.md)
Technical blog on implementing memory systems for coding agents using vector databases and retrieval patterns.

## RECENT WORKS

Recently I am working on coding agents and how to make them self-improved.

### [Autonomous self-improved software team](https://github.com/hungson175/AI-teams-controller-public)
Based on Claude-Code + tmux

### [coder-mem](https://github.com/hungson175/coder-mem)
I reverse-engineered claude-code and give it memory so it can improve itself

### [Deep-Research](https://github.com/hungson175/deep-research-langchain)
I rewrite the deep-research from langgraph to langchain - I hate langgraph, and it's a good exercise
